## What I Focused On

- **Building a clean and responsive layout** using Tailwind CSS, ensuring an intuitive user experience.
- **Implementing a real-time dashboard** with simulated agent activities and animations.
- **Creating an agent overview page** that displays agent statuses and allows users to trigger actions.
- **Adding interactivity** such as hover effects, status badges, and animations to enhance usability.

## What I Would Improve with More Time

- **Enhance animations** to create a smoother and more engaging experience.
- **Improve UI/UX** by refining styling, adding themes, and making the sidebar collapsible.
- **Implement better data handling** by introducing a state management solution like Zustand or Redux.
- **Integrate WebSockets** for real-time updates instead of using setTimeout() for simulating activity.
- **Expand agent functionality** by allowing dynamic task creation and history tracking.
- **Add unit and integration tests** to ensure the application is stable and maintainable.

  This project serves as a foundation for a real-time AI assistant dashboard, and with additional development, it could become a fully interactive and production-ready application.
